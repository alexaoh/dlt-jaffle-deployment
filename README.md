## Steps I Followed

1. `pip install "dlt[cli]"`
2. Run the pipeline locally.
3. `dlt deploy pipeline.py github-action --schedule "*/30 * * * *"` in order to make me a GitHub Actions workflow/pipeline from dlt template. Cool!

The steps are originally from [dlt-education](https://github.com/dlt-hub/dlthub-education/tree/main/courses/dlt_advanced_2025/deployment/github_actions), modified to my situation.
